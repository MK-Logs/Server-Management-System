# Server Management App - Course Project

This is a Server Management Application that allows for the creation, deletion, update, search, and pinging of servers within the network. The System is compartmentalized into frontend and backend components. The Frontend was developed using Angular, HTML, and CSS. The Backend was developed using the Spring Boot framework and is connected with a MySQL database. The two components integrate and communicate via the specified localhost IP. The backend is self-contained and can be coupled with different frontend frameworks and designs such as React or Django templates.
